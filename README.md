# TriageAI
> ML-powered email priority classification that gets your support team to the fires that matter — fast.

---

## The Problem

Customer support teams drown in email. Not all of it is urgent, but finding the emails that *are* urgent — before an angry enterprise client escalates — is a full-time job in itself.

**TriageAI automates that job.**

It reads incoming support emails and classifies them into four priority tiers: `Urgent`, `High`, `Medium`, and `Low` — so your team knows exactly where to look first.

## Results

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| Overall Accuracy | **82%** |
| Urgent Recall | **91%** |
| Model | Logistic Regression (class-balanced) |

> Urgent recall is the metric that matters most here. Missing an urgent email has real business consequences — a 91% catch rate means fewer fires slip through.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Exploration** — Analyse the raw email dataset to understand class distribution,
   spot the class imbalance (~10% urgent), and identify which raw attributes
   (subject length, body length, word count) are weak signals on their own.
2. **Feature Engineering** — Transform raw text into meaningful signals: exclamation count,
   urgent keyword frequency, problem keyword count, and sentiment polarity —
   the features that actually separate priorities.

## Key Findings from EDA

- **Text length is a weak signal** — urgent emails aren't necessarily longer or shorter.
- **Exclamation marks matter** — urgent emails contain significantly more.
- **Keyword frequency is decisive** — urgent keyword count is the strongest single predictor.
- **Sentiment skews negative** — urgent and high-priority emails tend toward more negative polarity.
